# Casa Frutero

## The First Ethereum Permanent Community Hub in Mexico

### An Initiative by Frutero

---

## The Opportunity

**Mexico City** is Latin America's largest metro (21M+ people) and a growing tech hub — but **no permanent physical anchor for Ethereum exists**. Developers work in isolation. Enterprise teams lack local Ethereum expertise. Founders have no systematic pathway to the global ecosystem.

**Casa Frutero** is a new initiative by Frutero to establish Mexico's first Ethereum Permanent Community Hub — a dedicated space where developers, founders, and enterprises connect with Ethereum.

**We're inviting the Ethereum Foundation to be the founding partner** — the first to shape this space with Ethereum's vision and values.
