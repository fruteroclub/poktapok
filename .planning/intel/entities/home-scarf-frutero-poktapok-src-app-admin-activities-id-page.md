# page.tsx

## Purpose

Dynamic route page that redirects visitors from `/admin/activities/[id]` to another location. Currently incomplete as the redirect destination is not specified.

## Exports

- `default` (async function `AdminActivityRedirect`) - Next.js page component that extracts the activity ID from route params and performs a redirect

## Dependencies

- next/navigation (redirect function)

## Used By

TBD

## Notes

The redirect call on line 9 is incomplete - it should include a destination URL. This appears to be placeholder code that needs implementation.
