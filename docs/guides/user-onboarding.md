## Common Questions

### Why was I approved as a guest instead of a member?

Guest status is the default approval path for first-time applicants. It ensures:
- Only committed users become full members
- Community remains high-quality and engaged
- You prove dedication through participation

**Think of it as**: Guest = "Welcome! Show us what you can do", Member = "You've proven your commitment"

### How long does it take to become a member?

**Typical timeline**: 4-8 weeks for active participants
- Depends on session frequency (usually 1-2 per week)
- Depends on activity completion rate
- Fastest path: Attend every session, complete activities quickly, maintain high quality

### Can I change my program after applying?

Not currently. You'll need to:
1. Complete your current program or withdraw
2. Apply for a new program
3. Program changes may be added in future updates

### What if I don't have a GitHub account?

GitHub is strongly recommended but not required. However:
- It significantly strengthens your application
- Shows technical background and coding activity
- Increases approval likelihood
- Consider creating one before applying

### Can I reapply if rejected?

Yes! You can reapply anytime with:
- Improved goal (more specific and measurable)
- Connected social accounts
- Completed GitHub profile
- Clearer alignment with program objectives

Review the rejection notes if provided by the admin.

### What happens if I'm inactive as a guest?

- Your account remains `guest` status
- You can resume participation anytime
- No automatic demotion or removal
- However, you won't progress toward membership

### Can I skip the guest tier?

Only in exceptional cases:
- Strong recommendation from trusted member
- Exceptional portfolio and proven track record
- Prior relationship with Poktapok team

Most users go through guest tier - it's not a negative, it's the standard path.

## Tips for a Strong Application

### Before You Apply

1. **Complete your GitHub profile** (if you have one)
   - Pin your best projects
   - Add clear README files
   - Show recent activity
   - Demonstrates technical capability

2. **Research your chosen program**
   - Understand the learning objectives
   - Review past activities and challenges
   - Align your goal with program focus

3. **Draft your goal offline first**
   - Write it in a text editor
   - Check character count (max 280)
   - Get feedback from friends or mentors
   - Revise for clarity and specificity

### Goal Writing Framework

Use this structure:
1. **What you'll learn**: Specific skills or technologies
2. **What you'll build**: Concrete projects or outputs
3. **How you'll prove it**: Deployment, documentation, public artifacts

**Template**:
> "Learn [specific skills], build [X projects] including [examples], deploy to [platform], and [document/share] learnings via [method]"

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Vague goals**: "Learn programming", "Get better at coding"
❌ **Unrealistic goals**: "Become expert in 3 languages and frameworks"
❌ **Off-topic goals**: Goals unrelated to chosen program track
❌ **No social accounts**: Makes it harder to verify credibility
❌ **Incomplete profiles**: Missing bio, location, or avatar
❌ **Trying to game the system**: Fake goals or copy-pasted from others

### What Admins Look For

✅ **Clarity**: Can you articulate what you'll do?
✅ **Commitment**: Does your goal show seriousness?
✅ **Alignment**: Does it match the program objectives?
✅ **Feasibility**: Can you achieve this in 30 days?
✅ **Authenticity**: Is this genuinely your goal?
✅ **Completeness**: Is your profile filled out?

## Troubleshooting

### I can't submit my application

**Check**:
- All required fields are filled out (red asterisks)
- Goal is between 1-280 characters
- Username meets format requirements (3-20 chars, lowercase)
- You've selected a program
- You're connected to the internet

**Still stuck?**: Clear browser cache and try again

### My avatar upload failed

**Possible causes**:
- File size > 5MB (compress your image)
- Unsupported format (use JPEG, PNG, or WebP)
- Network issue (check your connection)

**Solution**: Use an image compression tool like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) before uploading

### I want to change my username after submission

**Unfortunately**: Usernames cannot be changed once set. This is by design for identity consistency.

**Alternative**: If you haven't been approved yet, you can withdraw your application and reapply with a new profile.

### How do I check my application status?

1. Log in to your account
2. Your status is displayed in the navbar (top right)
3. Possible statuses: `incomplete`, `pending`, `guest`, `active`, `rejected`
