# Ethereum Community Hub Proposal Application

## **Casa Frutero - The First Ethereum Permanent Community Hub in Mexico**

## **Mexico City, Mexico**

---

### **1. Overview & Motivation**

**Question:** Why would establishing an Ethereum Community Hub in your city or region be impactful?

**Answer:**

Mexico City is Latin America's largest metropolitan area (21M+ population) and an emerging tech hub, yet it lacks a dedicated permanent space for the Ethereum community. Casa Frutero is positioned to become **Mexico's first official Ethereum Permanent Community Hub**.

**Current Landscape:**

- Growing Ethereum developer interest, evidenced by ETHMexico attendance growth
- Active local communities (Ethereum México, LaDAO creators of $XOC stablecoin) but no permanent physical anchor
- University talent pool (UNAM, ITESM, IPN) with limited exposure to Ethereum development
- No existing permanent coworking/community space focused on Ethereum in CDMX

**Why an Ethereum Permanent Hub in Mexico City?**

1. **First-Mover Opportunity**
   - No official Ethereum hub exists in Mexico or Central America
   - Establishes Ethereum presence in LATAM's largest market
   - Creates model replicable across the region

2. **Ecosystem Acceleration Alignment**
   - **dev/acc:** Physical anchor accelerates developer growth
   - **App Relations:** Demo days surface LATAM projects to global ecosystem
   - **Founder Success:** Systematic pipeline from hackathon → mentorship → incubation
   - **Enterprise Acceleration:** Location in professional district attracts corporate training

3. **Ecosystem Amplification**
   - Permanent physical presence extends Ethereum Everywhere mission
   - Weekly touchpoints create consistent community anchor
   - Bridge between local talent and global Ethereum network

4. **Additional EF Alignment**
   - **Privacy/PSE:** Hub available for ZK and privacy tech programming
   - **Protocol:** Node operation workshops, decentralization education
   - **Public Goods:** Open access model, no paywalls, community-first

**Existing Communities We'll Serve:**

- Ethereum México meetup community
- LaDAO (creators of $XOC, Mexican peso stablecoin)
- University blockchain clubs (UNAM, ITESM, IPN, Anáhuac)
- Frutero program alumni (400+ active builders)

**Current Ethereum Community Size:** ~500 active builders in CDMX area, with potential to 3x through consistent hub programming.

**The Invitation:**
Frutero has built the organization, network, and operational capacity to run a permanent community hub. We are now inviting the Ethereum Foundation to be the **founding partner** — the first to shape Casa Frutero with Ethereum's vision and values at its core.

### **9. Budget & Financial Plan**

**Question:** Do you have a high-level budget breakdown with estimated expenses and income sources?

**Answer:**

**Casa Frutero is a new initiative by Frutero, a sustainable organization.**

**Important distinction:**

- **Frutero** (the organization) is financially sustainable through DevRel services, programs, and partnerships
- **Casa Frutero** (the hub) is a new initiative that Frutero has the resources and network to support
- We are seeking the **Ethereum Foundation as the founding partner** to shape this space with Ethereum's vision and values

**Hub Monthly Operating Costs:**
| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Venue/Space | $800 |
| Utilities & Internet | $150 |
| Staff (Hub coordination) | $500 |
| Event Supplies | $200 |

| Partnerships | $2,000-3,500 |
| **Total** | **$8,500-11,000** |

**Path to Hub Sustainability:**

- **Year 1:** Frutero subsidizes base operations + EF founding partnership enables Ethereum programming
- **Year 2+:** Hub develops own sponsorship revenue from ecosystem partners attracted by Ethereum-first positioning
- **Long-term:** Self-sustaining through diversified sponsorship tiers and community partnerships

**Why This Model Works:**

- Frutero has proven ability to generate revenue and operate programs
- Hub benefits from Frutero's existing network and operational infrastructure
- EF partnership provides credibility and resources to establish Ethereum-first identity
- Other ecosystem partners can join as secondary sponsors once hub is established
