# Casa Frutero

## The Home for Impact Tech in LATAM

### Mexico City's Premier Community Hub for AI, Crypto, Privacy, Robotics & Culture

---

## The Opportunity

**Mexico City** is LATAM's largest metro (21M+ people) with growing tech talent — but no permanent physical anchor for the Impact Tech ecosystem. Talented builders work in isolation. Companies struggle to access authentic LATAM developer communities.

**Casa Frutero** solves this: a permanent community hub where **1,000+ builders across AI, Crypto, Privacy, Robotics, and Culture** gather weekly to learn, build, and connect.

**For sponsors: Authentic access to LATAM's most engaged Impact Tech community.**
